> **For Codex users:** Check out [oh-my-codex](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex) — the same orchestration experience for OpenAI Codex CLI.

**Multi-agent orchestration for Claude Code. Zero learning curve.**

_Don't learn Claude Code. Just use OMC._

## Quick Start

**Step 1: Install**

Marketplace/plugin install (recommended for most Claude Code users):

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode
/plugin install oh-my-claudecode
```

If you prefer the npm CLI/runtime path instead of the marketplace flow:

```bash
npm i -g oh-my-claude-sisyphus@latest
```

**Step 2: Setup**

```bash
# Inside a Claude Code / OMC session
/setup
/omc-setup

# From your terminal
omc setup
```

If you run OMC via `omc --plugin-dir <path>` or `claude --plugin-dir <path>`, add `--plugin-dir-mode` to `omc setup` (or export `OMC_PLUGIN_ROOT` before running it) so the installer doesn't duplicate skills/agents that the plugin already provides at runtime. See the [Plugin directory flags section in REFERENCE.md](./docs/REFERENCE.md#plugin-directory-flags) for a complete decision matrix and all available flags.

**Step 3: Build something**

```bash
# Inside a Claude Code / OMC session
/autopilot "build a REST API for managing tasks"

# Natural-language in-session shortcut
autopilot: build a REST API for managing tasks
```

That's it. Everything else is automatic.

### CLI Commands vs In-Session Skills

OMC exposes two different surfaces:

- **Terminal CLI commands**: run `omc ...` from your shell after installing the npm/runtime path (`npm i -g oh-my-claude-sisyphus@latest`) or from a local checkout.
- **In-session skills**: run `/...` inside a Claude Code session after installing the plugin/setup flow.

| Feature | Terminal CLI | In-session skill | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Setup | `omc setup` | `/setup` or `/omc-setup` | Both are real entrypoints. `/setup` is the easiest plugin-first path. |
| Ask providers | `omc ask codex "review this patch"` | `/ask codex "review this patch"` | Both route through the same advisor flow. |
| Team orchestration | `omc team 2:codex "review auth flow"` | `/team 3:executor "fix all TypeScript errors"` | Both exist, but they are different runtimes: `omc team` launches tmux CLI workers; `/team` runs the in-session native team workflow. |
| Autopilot / Ralph / Ultrawork / Deep Interview | — | `/autopilot ...`, `/ralph ...`, `/ultrawork ...`, `/deep-interview ...` | These are in-session skills. There is no `omc autopilot` / `omc ralph` / `omc ultrawork` CLI subcommand in this repo. |
| Autoresearch | `omc autoresearch ...` | `/deep-interview --autoresearch ...` | `omc autoresearch` is the real CLI command. The in-session path is the setup/interview lane that helps you launch it. |

### Not Sure Where to Start?

If you're uncertain about requirements, have a vague idea, or want to micromanage the design:

```
/deep-interview "I want to build a task management app"
```

The deep interview uses Socratic questioning to clarify your thinking before any code is written. It exposes hidden assumptions and measures clarity across weighted dimensions, ensuring you know exactly what to build before execution begins.

## Team Mode (Recommended)

Starting in **v4.1.7**, **Team** is the canonical orchestration surface in OMC. The legacy `swarm` keyword/skill has been removed; use `team` directly.

```bash
/team 3:executor "fix all TypeScript errors"
```

Use `/team ...` when you want Claude Code's in-session native team workflow. Use `omc team ...` when you want terminal-launched tmux CLI workers (`claude` / `codex` / `gemini` panes).
```
